# GameDevShowcase-JavaProject

A **Java-based 2D game** built using **Swing** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.
This project demonstrates **foundational game development skills**, including **animation, user input handling, collision detection, and rendering logic**.


## 🎮 Features

 **Interactive Gameplay:** Smooth user input handling via keyboard events.
 **2D Graphics Rendering:** Custom painting using Java Swing's `JPanel` and `Graphics` classes.
 **Animation Loop:** Optimized game loop for real-time updates.
 **Collision Detection:** Basic physics implementation for player and obstacles.
 **Modular Codebase:** Clean OOP structure with separate classes for entities, game logic, and UI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java (JDK 8+)
* **Frameworks:** Java Swing, AWT
* **Tools:** Eclipse IDE
* **Concepts Used:**

  * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  * Event-driven programming
  * Double buffering for smoother animations

## 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* **Java JDK 8+** installed.
* Any IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ/VS Code) or command-line setup.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/ShivanshPanwar/GameDevShowcase-JavaProject.git

   ```
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Run the main class:

   ```bash
   GameFrame.java
   ```
4. Play and enjoy!
